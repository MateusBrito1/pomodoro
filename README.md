# Pomodoro ⏰

Pomodoro is a project that helps you manage your tasks and projects using the Pomodoro technique, a time management method that can boost productivity and focus. With this application, you can name your tasks or projects and set a maximum time of 60 minutes to work on them. Additionally, you have the flexibility to interrupt the countdown at any time.

## How to Use

- On the home page, you'll find a form where you can name your task/project and set the desired time in minutes (with a maximum limit of 60 minutes).
- Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
- If you complete the time or wish to stop earlier, click "Stop" to end the Pomodoro session.
- In the "History" page, you can track your completed, ongoing, and interrupted tasks, helping you monitor your progress and pomodoro history.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- React
- Typescript
- Routing Library (react-router, react-router-dom, or another one used)
- Styled-components
- Hook-form
- Phosphor Icons

During development, we explored the capabilities of styled-components for styling and leveraged TypeScript to ensure typing and enhance code safety.
